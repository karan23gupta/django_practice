# Introducion
This is a django based web app that can be used to moniter the stocks prices.
# What's in the box?
At home page you will see some information about the stock market and option to login and/or register.
A new user can register and get in next page where he can enter the stock symbol and see the latest data about that stock symbol.
User can visit his profile as well and see which all stocks we saw and see his wishlist.
User can log out after he is done.
